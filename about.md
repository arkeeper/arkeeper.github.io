About This Site
---------
  
  This is just a simple site I created to post my thoughs about the card packs and boxes I open.
I'm also using it to learn website creation and editing.  So please bear with me as I learn and improve things.

Feel free to give me feedback, post comments, share, or never check this site again.  It's just for my enjoyment really.

About Me
--------
--------
  
  Like many of you, I collected in the late 80's and early 90's.  I mainly collected baseball and basketball cards, then later collected some Marvel cards among other things (Desert Storm!).  Then I hit middle school, packs got more expensive, and my funds were more limited.  I fell away from the hobby and didn't come back until just last summer.  I was in Target and saw Topps Archives baseball.  It was so cool that there was a card set of current players in the old 80's styles I used to collect!  So I bought some and LOVED opening the packs.  
    Then as I was picking up comics, I wandered into the sports card shop nearby (www.ultimatesportscards.com) and learned about hobby packs vs retail packs.  It was a fast and furious fall from there.  Researching online, finding out about online breaks, joining www.cardsmithsbreaks.com (my first break I remember was 2013 Topps Finest Football), trading locally and online, creating videos, and now this site.
  
My Personal Collection

Since getting back into the hobby, these are the main things that I've been collecting:    
  * Cincinnati Bengals - especially 2011-2013 rookies
  * Peyton Siva rookie autographs - trying to get 1 of every auto card version released
  * Teddy Bridgewater - Selectively collecting him since $$$
  * Early 90's Bills - I was a huge Bills fan when I was young and getting Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, Andre Reed, etc is fun
  * Cincinnati Reds - very small PC, but I have a few
  * Other teams or cards I like - I have a Peyton rookie, Lebron rookie, some cool Saints cards, among other things
